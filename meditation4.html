      <h1>Augustine on Intellectual Pride</h1>
      <h4>Augustine's thoughts on pretentiousness, and how they apply today.</h4>

    <blockquote>"The Church demanded that certain things should be believed even though they could not be proved, for if they could be proved, not all men could understand the proof, and some could not be proved at all. I thought that the Church was entirely honest in this and far less pretentious than the Manichees, who laughed at people who took things on faith, made rash promises of scientific knowledge, and then put forward a whole system of preposterous inventions which they expected their followers to believe on trust because they could not be proved" (Augustine 116)</blockquote>
<div class="writings">
    <p>&emsp;&emsp;(A strange, immature collection of thought follows, so feel free to skip after the first sentence) Augustine makes an interesting point about the honesty and humility of faith, versus the proud and torturous mirage of gnosis. But will we find gnosis in worldviews today? Are Augustine's words still applicable? Could it be that the Church has evolved to become the pretentious ones? Nay, for they have not "made rash promises of scientific knowledge", as far as I can tell. The spiritual mysteries that we face cannot be solved with empiricism. I suppose the next question would be "is there even such a thing as a spiritual mystery?" I think there could be, but it depends on how we define it. "Spiritual" could mean many things: here we may refer to it as the immaterial dimension of man. But what is the difference between spiritual and intellectual? Perhaps we can say it is that part of man that yearns for meaning, which is less concrete than the intellect. Hence a spiritual mystery could be such as was examined by Victor Frankl in his "Man's Search for Meaning". But what would be the difference between spiritual and psychological (for the latter is indeed Frankl's genre)? It may be that the spiritual and the intellect are so mysteriously intertwined that it is impossible to pull them apart, and that is the mystery that psychology (particularly fields dealing with personality and meaning) examines. Perhaps that is why psychologists speak in mystical phrases at times. But wouldn't it be gnosis to attempt to declare scientific conclusion from a spiritual, immaterial matter, that cannot be examined by empirical observation? I think so (but I will grant many exceptions). Hence, Augustine's words would apply in this case. I will have to meditate more on what this means. Would it mean throwing out psychology altogether (for I doubt granting exceptions will be logically consistent)? I think in this case we would be losing much wisdom, insight, and knowledge. Ultimately, it may be concluded that psychology's "gnosis" should be in the realm of that which is most observable, to make it pure empiricism, with faith going the rest of the way in spiritual mystery. Where that line is, it is hard to say.</p>
